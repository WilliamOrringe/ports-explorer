- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Use Cases

### Web Development
Running React (3000), API server (5000), and database (5432)? See them all at a glance and kill stuck processes instantly.

### Microservices
Managing multiple services locally? Group them by function and monitor their status in real-time.

### Port Conflicts
Getting "port already in use" errors? Quickly identify and terminate conflicting processes.

### Team Collaboration
Export your port groups and labels, share with your team for consistent development environments.

## Troubleshooting

### Ports not showing up?
- Click the refresh icon to manually scan
- Check if auto-refresh is enabled in settings
- Ensure processes are actually listening (not just running)

### Can't kill a process?
- Some system processes require elevated permissions
- Try running VS Code as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (macOS/Linux)

### Workspace filtering not working?
- Verify `portsExplorer.workspacePaths` includes your project directories
- Check that processes include workspace paths in their command line

## Privacy & Permissions

This extension:
- Only scans local network ports on your machine
- Does not send any data externally
- Stores configuration locally in VS Code settings
- Requires permission to read system process information
